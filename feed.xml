            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating my first blog on <a href="https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7%DA%AF%D9%81%D8%A7">Blogfa</a> when I was 10, has been one of the geekiest things I’ve ever done in my life. Being able to finally have an address of my own on the web was like a dream come true for me. Since then, I have created a number of blogs, none of which have been successful. Despite my inner desire to write, I have never been a successful blogger, actually, I have never been a blogger at all! All I did was sporadically write some random blog posts and then lose all the interest and motivation!</p><p>This time it’s going to be different, I have a new set of motivations and reasons to blog! I have realized that to be a successful blogger, it takes desire, consistency, and planning.</p><p>I intend to share my experiences, opinions, and adventures here. You may find posts mostly about computers, programming, games, and puzzles.</p>]]></content:encoded>
